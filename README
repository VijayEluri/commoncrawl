The start of the shared commoncrawl code repository.

Please set hadoop.version and hadoop.path in build.properties to point to your version of 
hadoop. 

Once commoncrawl.jar has been built, you can execute a job/sample via the bin/launcher.sh script.

For example, to run the BasicArcFileReaderSample against the ARC file 2010/01/07/18/1262876244253_18.arc.gz 
in the main commoncrawl bucket, commoncrawl-crawl-002, you would run the following command line:

  bin/launcher.sh org.commoncrawl.samples.BasicArcFileReaderSample <<AWS ACCESS KEY>>  <<AWS SECRET KEY>> commoncrawl-crawl-002 2010/01/07/18/1262876244253_18.arc.gz

The luancher runs the command in the background. You can monitor progress via either ./logs/<<ClassName>>.log for LOG output, or ./logs/<<ClassName>>_run.log for stdout output.
